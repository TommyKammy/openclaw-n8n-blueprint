# Claw App Quick Note (for Slack users)

Use only the **Claw** app in Slack. The separate Codex app is deprecated.

## Quick commands

- Check current model: `/status`
- Show model list/status: `/model status`
- Switch to Codex: `/model codex`
- Switch back to default Kimi: `/model k2p5`
- Start a fresh session: `/new`

## Important

- Commands must be sent as standalone slash commands.
- Example: send `/model codex` first, then send your normal prompt.
- If OpenAI quota is exceeded, switch back with `/model k2p5`.
